This repository contains the most important code for the exploration of PETPrep results and a docker file to create a fuzzy PETPrep. The repository is not cleaned and contains files that are no longer used. It was used for experimentation and exploration purposes only and does not contain production-ready code. 

Also this is a poetry project.

experiments.ipynb contains experiments that created a few of the graphs in the report.

Dockerfile.fuzzy-petprep was made to build the fuzzy environment. 

compare_voxels*.py files contain voxel-wise comparisons with various purposed.

fuzzy_test.py proved that the fuzzy environment was properly set up in one test.
